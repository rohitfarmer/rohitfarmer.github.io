Thank you for visiting my website.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I am a Computational Biologist at Medical Science & Computing (MSC), LLC and stationed at the Center for Human Immunology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. Before moving to the USA, I worked as an assistant professor at the Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, India.  

I did my PhD from the University of Birmingham, UK with Peter J. Winn, on the prestigious scholarship from the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. My PhD thesis titled “Modelling polyketide synthases and related macromolecular complexes“. My past research interests include understanding protein structure-function relationship, modelling large macromolecular complexes, molecular dynamics simulations and antibiotic synthesis (see Research). During my postdoctoral fellowship, at the Washington University in St. Louis I worked on the application of Deep Learning in chemistry and medicine. I built models to predict drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) caused by bioactivated drug molecules.  

I am fond of technology, photography, reading and writing, and travelling. My latest interests are learning project management skills, spin-offs and startups, computer security, and anonymity over the internet.  

None of the content on this website reflects the views of any of my past or present employers.
