<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I am a computational biologist at <a href="https://www.mscweb.com" target="_blank">Medical Science & Computing (MSC), LLC,</a> and working on site at the <a href="https://chi.niaid.nih.gov" target="_blank">Center for Human Immunology (CHI)</a>, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD. Before moving to the USA, I worked as an assistant professor at the <a href="http://shuats.edu.in/" target="_blank">Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology & Sciences, India</a>.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I did my PhD from the University of Birmingham, UK with <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/biosciences/winn-peter.aspx" target="_blank">Peter J. Winn</a>, and <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/biosciences/thomas-chris.aspx" target="_blank">Chris M. Thomas</a>. My PhD scholarship was funded by the prestigious <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/funding/darwin-studentships.aspx" target="_blank">Darwin Trust of Edinburgh</a>. My PhD thesis titled <a href="https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/5909/" target="_blank">"Modelling polyketide synthases and related macromolecular complexes"</a>. My past research interests include understanding protein structure-function relationship, modelling large macromolecular complexes, molecular dynamics simulations and antibiotic synthesis (see <a href="https://rohitfarmer.github.io/research/">Research</a>). During my postdoctoral fellowship, at the Washington University in St. Louis I worked with <a href="http://swami.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">S. Joshua Swamidass</a> on the application of deep learning in chemistry and medicine. I built models to predict drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) caused by bioactivated drug molecules.

My latest interests are learning project management skills, spin-offs and startups, computer security, and anonymity over the internet.
