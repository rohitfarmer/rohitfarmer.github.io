Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a postdoctoral research associate working with S. Joshua Swamidass, at the School of Medicine at the Washington University in St. Louis. Before moving to the USA I worked as an assistant professor at the Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, India.

I did my PhD from the University of Birmingham, UK with Peter J. Winn, on the prestigious scholarship from the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. My PhD thesis titled “Modelling polyketide synthases and related macromolecular complexes“. My past research interests include understanding protein structure-function relationship, modelling large macromolecular complexes, molecular dynamics simulations and antibiotic synthesis (see Research). During my postdoctoral fellowship, I am extending my expertise in the rapidly developing field of Deep Learning, a new computational technique, to solve medically relevant problems. I am building models to predict how drugs are “bio-activated” into toxic molecules and cause drug-induced liver injuries (DILI).

I am fond of technology, photography, reading and writing, and travelling. My latest interests are learning project management skills, spin-offs and startups, computer security, and anonymity over the internet.
